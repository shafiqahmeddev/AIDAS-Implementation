## 🚗 Overview

AIDAS is a cutting-edge security protocol designed specifically for autonomous vehicle ecosystems. It implements a multi-layered security approach combining hardware-level security (PUF), advanced cryptography (Chaotic Maps), and AI-based intrusion detection (DQN) to ensure secure authentication and communication between autonomous vehicles, charging stations, operators, and service providers.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔐 Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF)**: Hardware-based security for unique device identification
- **🌀 Chaotic Map Cryptography**: Advanced key generation using logistic chaotic maps
- **🤖 AI-Enhanced Security**: Deep Q-Network (DQN) based intrusion detection system
- **🔄 Multi-Entity Authentication**: Secure protocol for Operators, AVs, Charging Stations, and ESP
- **📊 Real-time Monitoring**: Performance metrics and security status visualization
- **⚡ Low Latency**: Average authentication time of 6.4ms

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shafiqahmeddev/AIDAS-Implementation.git
cd AIDAS-Implementation

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the interactive demo
python interactive_demo.py

# Run the main protocol simulation
python aidas_protocol.py
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Interactive Demo
The interactive demo provides a menu-driven interface to explore all AIDAS features:

```bash
python interactive_demo.py
```

Options include:
1. Full demonstration of all features
2. PUF simulation demo
3. Chaotic cryptography demo
4. AI intrusion detection demo
5. Complete authentication demo
6. Security analysis
7. Performance metrics

### Protocol Simulation
Run a complete performance evaluation:

```bash
python aidas_protocol.py
```

This will:
- Create multiple entities (operators, vehicles, charging stations)
- Simulate authentication sessions
- Generate performance reports
- Display real-time monitoring dashboard

chaotic_map = ChaoticMap(r=3.99, x0=0.1)
key = chaotic_map.generate_key(32)  # 32-byte key
```

### 3. DQN Intrusion Detector
```python
detector = DQNIntrusionDetector()
result = detector.detect_intrusion(network_features)
```

### 4. Entity Creation
```python
simulator = AIDASimulator()
operator = simulator.create_operator("OP001", "password", bio_data)
vehicle = simulator.create_vehicle("AV001")
station = simulator.create_charging_station("CS001")
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics
